# LLM Inference Optimization: Quantization for Efficient Large Language Models

## Overview

This project explores state-of-the-art optimization techniques—specifically **dynamic quantization** to accelerate inference for large language models (LLMs). By comparing baseline full‑precision inference against optimized models on an M1 Mac, we aim to reduce latency and memory consumption while preserving output quality. The work demonstrates practical applications of model compression strategies for real-world deployment in resource-constrained environments.

## Motivation

Large language models have achieved remarkable results in NLP but are notorious for high inference costs. This project:
- **Reduces latency:** By compressing model weights and streamlining computations.
- **Decreases memory footprint:** Through lower-precision operations and sparse weight representations.
- **Maintains quality:** Balancing performance with minimal impact on output fidelity.

The work is particularly relevant for deploying AI services on edge devices or platforms with limited resources.

## Key Features

- **Dynamic Quantization Pipeline**: Implements INT8 quantization using PyTorch's `qnnpack` engine, specifically optimized for transformer architectures
- **Automated Benchmarking Suite**: Comprehensive performance analysis across multiple metrics:
  - Inference latency (mean and standard deviation)
  - Memory utilization tracking
  - Token generation throughput
- **Multi-Modal Inference Support**: Optimized for various compute environments:
  - CPU optimization with `qnnpack`
  - Automatic device selection (CPU/MPS)
  - Memory-efficient inference patterns

## Performance Metrics

The framework provides extensive benchmarking capabilities:
- Warm-up run elimination to ensure accurate timing
- Statistical analysis over multiple inference runs (n=20 by default)
- Memory tracking at the process level
- Token generation speed analysis
